# New Keynsian Dynamic Stohastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model

This repository contains the solution to a theoretical assignment that explores a New Keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model with price rigidity.

The project contains the model derivation and matlab code for stohastic simulation.
